 ## Meta Hacking
 - Start with a presentation of the high level concepts so everyone has the same understanding of the how the different components fit together
 - Build a list of exercises that we want to do during workshop.
 - Split into groups, everyone choses which exercise he wants to do according to interest and skill
 - Phase build/hack/learn
 - Phase present: results of 3) to the group, discuss achievements, what has been learned, what has not been understood, what has been difficult
 - Rinse and repeat 4)-5) until exhaustion :-)
