# Hello Metanet - Developers Weekend !

### Idea
  Get together and try to understand how bitcoinsv can be used to develop applications using planaria, bitdb, siteloader etc.

### Context
  In the past few months a new computing paradigm seems to emerge:
Based on Bitcoin SV + onchain data and code + _unwriters tools (Planaria, bitsocket, bitdb, b://, c://, ..) + other tools (Moneybutton, siteloader, A.N.N.E, ...) this opens a whole new world of developing applications.

### Target audience
Developers of all shapes and sizes -but also non-developers, interested in understanding what possibilites the bitcoin computer can offer

### General approach
Learning by doing: building together first easy and then maybe not so easy things on top of bitcoin do so by alternating phases of building/hacking/learning with phases of presentation where we present to the group what we have learnt/achieved.

### Goals
understand how everything fits together
doing so by developing small (or not so small) apps, websites, ..

### How
Get together for a weekend in Berlin, learn, build and have fun doing so

### Costs
1 BSV per participant
Payment via Handcash or Moneytbutton
