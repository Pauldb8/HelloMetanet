# HelloMetanet
Public website about the Hello MetaNet Workshops
"Hello MetaNet"-Workshop
Berlin, 18. - 19 May 2019

 

Idea
Get together and try to understand how bitcoinsv can be used to develop applications using planaria, bitdb, siteloader etc.

Context
In the past few months a new computing paradigm seems to emerge:
Based on Bitcoin SV + onchain data and code + _unwriters tools (Planaria, bitsocket, bitdb, b://, c://, ..) + other tools (Moneybutton, siteloader, A.N.N.E, ...) this opens a whole new world of developing applications.

Goals
understand how everything fits together
doing so by developing small (or not so small) apps, websites, ..

How
Get together for a weekend in Berlin, learn, build and have fun doing so
