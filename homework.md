# HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT ðŸ˜Š

Hi participants of the worlds first "Hello Metanet" workshop in Berlin!
It's only a few days now until it all starts happening, and we're very much looking forward to it.
To make sure that we all start with some common foundations, we (the organisation committee) ask you to do some preparation:

Intellectual stuff to read or watch, mandatory:
- Planarias introduction to the bitcoin computer: https://docs.planaria.network/#/intro
- Article by brendan lee (Tokenized) about bitcoin as world computer: https://coingeek.com/bitcoin-as-a-world-computer/
- Unwriters historic endorsement of Biitcoin SV "The resolutioin of the Bitcoin Cash experiment": https://medium.com/@_unwriter/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-cash-experiment-52b86d8cd187
- Brendan Lee: what is the metanet: https://youtu.be/LbFoz7JKqkU
- Joshua Henslee "unwriter tools explained" including suggestions for use cases: https://www.yours.org/content/_unwriter-s-tools-explained--practical-use-cases-reviewed-93d7bff2fef8

Bonus, not mandatory, in case you are hooked and have time to spare:
- Brendan Lee: The power of scale: https://youtu.be/4Bni20gEIcA
- Craig Wright about Turing completeness of Bitcoin Script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moA7KASx3WE (slightly technical/mathematical)
- Joshua Henslee: example of a one-page checkout blocksite: https://www.yours.org/content/one-page-checkout-using-handcash---moneybutton---100--on-chain-3dc2e9399d36
- Daniel Krawisz about programming with planaria: https://youtu.be/QMQ4KYU4Uzw

Organisational nitty-gritty:
- install the bottle browser on your machine
- get a moneybutton account https://www.moneybutton.com
- get a mobile bsv wallet https://handcash.io/ or https://www.centbee.com/
- get a github account. We want to use github for documentation purposes
- get a account in the atlantis slack (https://bitdb.network/atlantis). We could ask for help in there.

So that's it!

[See you in Berlin on the 18.5.](weekend) (or maybe the evening before)!
